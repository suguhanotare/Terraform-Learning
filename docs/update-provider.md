# Update a Terraform Provider

## Goal üéØ

The goal of this file is to document the update process of a Terraform provider

## XXXX üõ†Ô∏è

## Explore provider.tf
Open the provider.tf file. Here you will find the terraform block which specifies the required provider version and required Terraform version for this configuration.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    btp = {
      source  = "SAP/btp"
      version = "~> 1.15.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Explore terraform.lock.hcl üõ†Ô∏è
When you initialize a Terraform configuration for the first time with Terraform 1.1 or later, Terraform will generate a new `.terraform.lock.hcl` file in the current working directory.

For example the block with the SAP BTP provider:
```terraform
provider "registry.terraform.io/sap/btp" {
  version     = "1.15.1"
  constraints = "~> 1.15.0"
```

 The BTP provider version is v1.15.1. This fulfills the ~>=1.15.1 constraint, but is no longer the latest version of the BTP provider. 

> [!NOTE]
> For the SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform) Terraform provider, constraints = "~> 1.15.0" specifies a version range in your Terraform config.
> What ~> means:
> - Allows patch version updates within the minor version 1.15.x
> - Compatible versions: 1.15.0, 1.15.1, 1.15.2, etc.
> - Blocks: 1.16.x, 1.17.x (major/minor version changes)

## Upgrade the SAP BTP Provider Version üõ†Ô∏è

```bash
  terraform init -upgrade
```
The -upgrade flag will upgrade all providers to the latest version consistent within the version constraints specified in your configuration.



Open the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file and notice that the BTP provider's version is now the latest version.
